lullaby
=======

Lullaby is an application that allows you to make playlists that you can set on a timer. Depending on the settings, you can have the screen go black when it starts playing and also have the computer go to sleep once the timer is up. The idea is to have some background music for when you're trying to sleep.

This is still a work in progress. The UI could be improved. There's also more functionality to add and bugs to fix. 

Clicking the 'About' button in the application will note which libraries were used.

Running
-------

After cloning the repository, Lullaby.jar can be run as is. It will just need to be in the same folder structure because it depends on certain files and folders existing.
