---------

- Still need to update defaults on application close
***- Still need to add values for playlist and last path

---------

- Fixed the skip stuff by switching audio libraries.
  - Add note in 'About' section for the new library.
  - Add WavToMp3 converter since the current library only supports mp3

Actual list of things to do
===========================
***- Get rid of the line problem. (*Solved but might want to take a look at this again)

***- Make it so you don't have to save in order for the playlist ORDER to be in effect? (*It looks like this works)
  - Might be a problem with updating the model.
  
***- Have it stop when you switch playlists? (*Put this in, but do we really want this?)

- Save settings on application close (think more about this)

- Perhaps eventually a drag song to playlist option (*Do we really want this)

- Might want to think more about when to update the "defaults"

- Add "Save changes?" dialog when going to new or saved playlist (particularly for loading)
  - If you click Cancel, it still goes to the new playlist/clears the current playlist - it shouldn't do anything
  - So it should do the following:
    - Click New or Load
    - Dialog pops up asking whether you want to save
    - If yes, another dialog pops up asking you what to save it as
      - Once saved, go on with the original request
      - If cancel is selected, don't proceed with the original request
    - If no, go on with the original request

- New library stuff
  - Maybe think of a WmaToMp3 converter (would need another 3rd party converter)

- Try making a build of the project
  - Include an installer?

- Make the directories created by the program

- Make fullscreen look better

- Add pause?
  - Make the play button change to "Pause" once playing and have the correct functionality
  
- Add sleep.exe note
